# TicTacToe_Project
The Tic Tac Toe project is a classic implementation of the well-known game, designed to be played by two players taking turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of three marks (either "X" or "O") before the opponent does.
